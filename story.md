title: Beer Quest - On Finding the "BOBO"
subtitle: Looking into the World of Gluten Free Beer
---

### <u>Our adventure takes place during the 2010s, gluten-free food made a breakthrough in popularity and was much more available in general shops. Interestingly, in France and Belgium, people came up with stereotypes regarding gluten-free consumers and products, describing such a trend as a flash in a pan. One of those stereotypes is about the persona of gluten-free buyers, often described as urban snobbish people who want to distinguish themselves socially by consuming non-usual products, called "Bobo" in European French-speaking areas.</u>

### <span style="color: red;">The international Beer league sent us, the renowned elite Beer detectives to unveil the Bobos, study their characteristics and particularities, and determine if they are a threat to the international Beer drinker community.</span>

### The Footprint of the Bobo, When and Where?

### <span style="color: blue;">As seasoned detectives, and to start our quest, we first need to gather all the information relevant to find the Bobos.</span>

### Another section

### Another section 2

### <span style="color: red;">We needed to study the temporal activity of the Bobos to see if they were plotting something shady.</span>
#### For that, our temporal analysis will be done in two steps.
<span style="color: red;">Step 1: Checking the number of reviews per year for gluten free beers globally.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Step 2: Checking the number of reviews per year for gluten free beers as a function of the location.</span>


# TODO: put the figure of the gluten free beer evolution here!! 

### <span style="color: green;">This plot clearly shows that the ammount of reviews for gluten-free beers is increasing.</span>
### <span style="color: blue;">However, seasoned detectives like us must always stay vigilant: is the reason for this increase because of the increase of the popularity of the site? Or is it because of the increase of total number of reviews in the dataset?</span>

# TODO: put the figure of the gluten free beer proportion evolution here!! 

### <span style="color: green;">With that we are sure: the increase of gluten-free beers reviews is not due to the increase of the total number of reviews in the dataset. There can only be one explanation for that: the Bobos are clearly more and more present, globally.</span>

### <span style="color: red;">But, where are they? We now need to go to study the spatial distribution of the Bobos through their beer reviews.</span>

#### <span style="color: green;">Here we define `ratio` as the ratio of the number of reviews for glutenfree beers to the non-glutenfree beers. For each country, the ratio is a representative of the "enrichment of glutenfree beer reviews", reflecting the popularity of glutenfree beers in that country.
#### <span style="color: green;">We then color the countries according to the ratio, and visualize the absolute number of users and reviews for glutenfree beers at the same time. This step was done using an interactive map.</span>

# TODO: Show the gluten_free_reviews_per_country map!!!
Interactive map. The size of the human icon represents the number of users, but the size-scaling follows a cubic root function to avoid the dominance of large countries (This was decided arbitrarily).

### <span style="color: red;">Until now, our investigation pointed us towards some specific countries that we think most likely contain the Bobos Heaquarters: France, Belgium, Canada and the United States of America. Thus, it would be interesting to see the temporal evolution of gf reviews specifically in these countries.</span>
