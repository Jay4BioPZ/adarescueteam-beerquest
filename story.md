Our adventure takes place during the 2010s, gluten-free food made a breakthrough in popularity and was much more available in general shops. Interestingly, in France and Belgium, people came up with stereotypes regarding gluten-free consumers and products, describing such a trend as a flash in a pan. One of those stereotypes is about the persona of gluten-free buyers, often described as urban snobbish people who want to distinguish themselves socially by consuming non-usual products, called "Bobo" in European French-speaking areas.

The international Beer league sent us, the renowned elite Beer detectives to unveil the Bobos, study their characteristics and particularities, and determine if they are a threat to the international Beer drinker community.
