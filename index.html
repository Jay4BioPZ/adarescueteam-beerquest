<h1>Investigation Overview</h1>

Our adventure takes place during the 2010s, gluten-free food made a breakthrough in popularity and was much more available in general shops. Interestingly, in France and Belgium, people came up with stereotypes regarding gluten-free consumers and products, describing such a trend as a flash in a pan.
